1.  We have not begun constructing anythying yet, but we have started making calculations for the motors of the drone. 

2.  We have not ordered anything because we don't know what we need yet. Once we finish calculating, we will start ordering parts. 

3.  We have not begun designing parts yet. We will start designing the frame of the drone very soon. 

4.  If we are able to complete our project by May 16th we will have all the functional elements that are required because we will have LEDs indicating the process in which it's doing, we'll have a controller for the drone, we'll have a distance sensor and a GPS module, we'll use actuators to turn the propellers, and we'll use programmed logic, integrated ciruits, calculations and data storage/retrival, advanced and/or multiple interfaced microcontrollers, and wifi/bluetooth module

5.  The three challenges that I think we will have is defying gravity with the motors and propellers, designing a lightweight frame, and setting up the controller. The actual coding part of this project will be relatively easy.
